My brief was to use design provided and make it responsive. This test should help to evaluate my current skill set, my ability to follow orders, my timeliness and my eye for detail.

Built the design in HTML and CSS.(no Bootstrap or JS)
Design is responsive. Personally tested on different devices such as i-phone 5, laptop, 24 inch screen and tablet.

Unfortunately I do not know Sass or Gulp so no bonus points :(
