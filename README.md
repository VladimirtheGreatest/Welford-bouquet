My brief was to use design provided and make it responsive. This test should help to evaluate my current skill set, my ability to follow orders, my timeliness and my eye for detail.

Built the design in HTML and CSS.(no Bootstrap or JS)
Design is responsive. Personally tested on different devices such as i-phone 5, laptop, 24 inch screen and tablet. I used flexbox without css grid to increase browser compatibility.

Design is desktop first since I was given an image to follow without specific widths and heights and I could choose my own mobile layout. (considering my desktop is 24inch that should be the closest to the original I guess).
